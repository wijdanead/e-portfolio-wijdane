### 🌟 Featured Project  
#### 🧾 SIEM Implementation & Attack Simulation using Wazuh  

**Description:**  
Designed and deployed a full **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** environment using **Wazuh** and **Suricata** to collect, correlate, and analyze security events in real time.  
The project included **attack simulations** (SSH brute-force, Nmap port scanning, reverse shell, EICAR test) and **automated response** via Bash scripting.

**Main Tasks:**  
- Installed and configured Wazuh components (Manager, Indexer, Dashboard, Agents).  
- Simulated multiple attack scenarios using Hydra, Nmap, and msfvenom.  
- Implemented automated IP blocking scripts integrated into Wazuh Active Response.  
- Configured firewall rules and monitored alerts on both Linux and Windows systems.

**Tools Used:**  
Wazuh 4.12, Suricata, Kali Linux, Ubuntu 22.04, Hydra, Nmap, Bash  

**Results:**  
- Real-time detection of brute-force and scanning attempts.  
- Automatic blocking of attacker IPs for 10 minutes.  
- Strengthened understanding of SIEM architecture and security automation.
